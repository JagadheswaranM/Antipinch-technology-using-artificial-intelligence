# Antipinch-technology-using-artificial-intelligence
This is the project where the anti pinch technology is done with the help of Artificial Intelligence
Antipinch is a safety system used in power windows of a car. This technology provents the winding up of the window if it senses any obstacle in the path of the glass. The electric motor is fitted with a sensor that can sense the resistive force acting against the motion of the glass. 
In this project, the antipinch technology is done with the help of image processing. An AI python program which detects the hand movement near the window is used in this project. If any hand movements is recognised near the window during the winding up of window the electric motor operates in the opposite direction and brings the window down and thus it prevents the accidental winding up of the power window. A message is sent from the python program if any hand movements is detected. The message is then sent to the controller using communication protocol and thus the controller, controls the direction of the motor. The controller used in this project is NI myDAQ
